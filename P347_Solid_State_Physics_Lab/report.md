## ABSTRACT

In this experiment, the frequency and temperature dependence of the dielectric properties of barium titanate (BaTiO₃) were studied to investigate its ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition. The dielectric constant and dissipation factor of BaTiO₃ were measured over a frequency range of 5–50 kHz using a Schering bridge method. The capacitance variation with frequency was also studied for multilayer ceramic and disc ceramic capacitors. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant of BaTiO₃ was examined at different frequencies to identify the Curie temperature. A clear peak in the dielectric constant was observed near 130 °C, indicating the ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition. The diffuseness parameter of the phase transition was evaluated from the logarithmic plot in the paraelectric region and found to be δ = 0.2682, suggesting a sharp, normal ferroelectric transition. The experimental results qualitatively agree with dielectric theory and demonstrate the characteristic polarization mechanisms in ferroelectric ceramics.

## **RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

### **1. Frequency Dependence of Dielectric Constant of BaTiO₃**

Figure **2** shows the variation of the dielectric constant of BaTiO₃ as a function of frequency in the range 5–50 kHz. The dielectric constant decreases monotonically with increasing frequency. At lower frequencies, the dielectric constant has a higher value due to the significant contribution of space-charge and dipolar polarization mechanisms, which can respond effectively to slowly varying electric fields.

As the frequency increases, these slower polarization processes fail to follow the alternating electric field, resulting in a reduction of the net polarization and hence a decrease in the dielectric constant. This behaviour is characteristic of polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramics and confirms the frequency-dependent nature of dielectric response in BaTiO₃.

### **2. Frequency Dependence of Capacitance of MLCC**

The variation of capacitance with frequency for the multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) is shown in Figure **3**. The capacitance decreases sharply as the frequency increases from 10 kHz to 40 kHz. This reduction is attributed to the suppression of interfacial and dipolar polarization mechanisms at higher frequencies.

At lower frequencies, these polarization mechanisms contribute effectively, leading to higher capacitance values. With increasing frequency, only faster polarization mechanisms remain active, resulting in a lower measured capacitance. The observed trend confirms the expected dielectric behaviour of multilayer ceramic capacitors.

### **3. Frequency Dependence of Capacitance of Disc Ceramic Capacitor**

Figure **4** shows the capacitance versus frequency plot for the disc ceramic capacitor. A similar decreasing trend is observed, with capacitance reducing significantly at lower frequencies and approaching a nearly constant value at higher frequencies. This saturation indicates that beyond a certain frequency, most polarization mechanisms are unable to contribute to the dielectric response.

The similarity in trends observed for both MLCC and disc ceramic capacitors highlights the general frequency-dependent nature of ceramic dielectrics.

### **4. Temperature Dependence of Dielectric Constant of BaTiO₃**

Figure **5** shows the variation of dielectric constant of BaTiO₃ with temperature at four different frequencies: 15 kHz, 25 kHz, 35 kHz, and 45 kHz. For all frequencies, the dielectric constant increases with temperature, reaches a maximum near **130 °C**, and then decreases on further heating.

The temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant is identified as the **Curie temperature (T₍c₎ ≈ 130 °C)**, indicating the **ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition** in BaTiO₃. The Curie temperature remains nearly the same for all frequencies, demonstrating that the phase transition is intrinsic to the material and not frequency dependent.

However, the magnitude of the dielectric constant decreases with increasing frequency, consistent with reduced polarization response at higher frequencies.

### **5. Diffuseness Parameter and Nature of Phase Transition**

The diffuseness parameter was evaluated using the plot shown in Figure **6**, where
[
\ln!\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon} - \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\max}}\right)
]
is plotted against
[
\ln(T - T_c)
]
for temperatures above the Curie temperature.

From the linear fit to the experimental data in the paraelectric region, the slope of the line was obtained as

[
\boxed{\delta = 0.2682}
]

A smaller value of the diffuseness parameter indicates a **sharper dielectric peak**, suggesting that the BaTiO₃ sample exhibits behaviour closer to that of a **normal ferroelectric** rather than a diffuse phase transition system. The low value of δ may arise due to the limited number of data points in the paraelectric region, experimental uncertainties in capacitance and temperature measurements, and assumptions involved in determining the maximum dielectric constant.

Nevertheless, the linear nature of the plot confirms Curie–Weiss-type behaviour above the Curie temperature and validates the experimental method used to estimate the diffuseness parameter.

## **SOURCES OF ERROR**

1. **Temperature Measurement and Control Errors**
   The temperature of the BaTiO₃ sample was measured using an RTD placed close to the sample. However, thermal gradients between the heater, sample, and sensor can lead to discrepancies between the actual sample temperature and the recorded value. This effect becomes significant near the Curie temperature, where the dielectric constant changes rapidly with temperature.

2. **Limited Temperature Resolution near Curie Point**
   The temperature was varied in finite steps, resulting in a limited number of data points near the Curie temperature. This affects the accuracy in determining the exact value of the maximum dielectric constant (εₘₐₓ) and introduces uncertainty in the evaluation of the diffuseness parameter.

3. **Contact Resistance and Electrode Imperfections**
   Imperfect electrical contact between the spring-loaded probes and the conducting surfaces of the BaTiO₃ sample can introduce additional series resistance. This affects the measured capacitance and dissipation factor, especially at higher frequencies.

4. **Assumption of Ideal Bridge Balance**
   The Schering bridge balance was determined by observing minimum signal on the CRO. Human judgment in identifying the null condition introduces subjective error, leading to uncertainty in the measured values of C₄ and R₄.

5. **Instrumental Limitations at Higher Frequencies**
   At higher frequencies, stray capacitances of connecting leads and internal circuit elements become comparable to the sample capacitance. These parasitic effects can cause deviations in the measured dielectric constant and capacitance.

6. **Frequency Stability of the Oscillator**
   Small fluctuations in the oscillator frequency affect the calculation of dissipation factor, which depends linearly on frequency. This contributes to uncertainty in the loss measurements.

7. **Data Range Used for Diffuseness Analysis**
   The diffuseness parameter was calculated using a limited number of data points in the paraelectric region (T > T₍c₎). This restricted data range reduces the statistical reliability of the linear fit and contributes to deviation of δ from ideal theoretical values.

8. **Polycrystalline Nature of the Sample**
   BaTiO₃ is a polycrystalline ceramic, and variations in grain size, defects, and grain boundaries can lead to local variations in dielectric response. These inhomogeneities affect the sharpness of the dielectric peak and the extracted value of the diffuseness parameter.

CONCLUSION

The dielectric behaviour of BaTiO₃ was systematically studied as a function of frequency and temperature. The dielectric constant and capacitance were found to decrease with increasing frequency, confirming the reduced contribution of slower polarization mechanisms at higher frequencies. The dissipation factor increased with frequency, indicating enhanced dielectric losses due to delayed dipolar response.

The temperature-dependent study revealed a pronounced peak in the dielectric constant at approximately 130 °C for all measured frequencies, identifying the Curie temperature and confirming the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition in BaTiO₃. The invariance of the Curie temperature with frequency shows that the transition is intrinsic and structural in nature.

The diffuseness parameter calculated from the paraelectric region was δ = 0.2682, indicating a sharp dielectric peak and behaviour closer to a normal ferroelectric material. Deviations from ideal theoretical values can be attributed to experimental limitations and finite data resolution. Overall, the experiment successfully demonstrates the fundamental dielectric and phase transition properties of BaTiO₃ and validates the use of dielectric measurements in studying ferroelectric materials.
